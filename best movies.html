    <h1>The Best Movies According to Chynna</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>MIB 3</h3>
    <p>
      I like Griffin's scenes about all possible future timelines and outcomes.
      There are also beautiful lines that I like in the movie.
    </p>

    <h3>Birth</h3>
    <p>Cameron Bright is handsome and I like the bathtub scene.</p>

    <h3>The Island</h3>
    <p>
      This is where I discovered Scarlett Johansson and noticed how pretty she
      is.
